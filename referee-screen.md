## Principles Of The Game

**0. PCs’ big dreams and moral codes.**

1. Nowhere is safe.
2. Resources are scarce.
3. Players lead the way.
4. Rumors abound.
5. Everything is personal.
6. The end is never set.
7. Death is a part of life.
8. Hope never dies.

### Goals

- Stay alive.
- Help those in need.
- Search for information.
- Find a safe haven.
- Stake a claim.
- Reveal operation reset.
- Find a way home.

## Random Encounters

- Travel: Draw 1 encounter for each 10-kilometer hex the PCs enter.
- City travel: Draw 1 encounter for every 1-kilometer hex that the PCs enter.
- Stationary: Draw 1 encounter per shift.
  - For each shift after the first, roll on the special encounter table on page 13. Add +1 to the roll for each subsequent shift.

Encounters start on page 16. If you draw an encounter without the symbol matching the current mode of travel/stationary/shift, no encounter occurs.

### Making Encounters Personal

- Keep the PCs’ big dreams and moral codes in mind.
- Connect a new encounter to something that has happened before.
- Pick a PCs and spring the worst of the encounter on them.
- In an encounter with negotiation give one individual PC a juicy offer.
- Every now and then, let an NPC tag along with the PCs – preferably one that the PCs care about.

## Dice

### Modifiers

- STEPPING UP: When you have a positive modifier, always step up your higher die first, until it reaches a D12 – then step up your other die. If you have no other die, instead add a D6 (as one step up) and step it up further as needed. You can never go above two D12s, no matter what modifiers you have.
- STEPPING DOWN: When you have a negative modifier, always downstep your lower die first. If a D6 is downgraded, it’s removed (counting as one step down). Then downstep your remaining base die as needed. You can never get downstepped below a single D6 – you will always have at least a 1 in 6 chance to succeed.

### Help

- For each person helping you, you get a +1 modifier. No more than three people can help you with a single roll, meaning your maximum modifier from getting help is +3.

### Opposed Rolls

Sometimes, rolling a isn’t enough to succeed with your skill roll. In some cases, you have to beat your foe in an opposed roll. To win an opposed roll, you must roll successfully and roll more than your adversary. Every your adversary rolls eliminates one of your . Only you (the active party) can push your roll.

### Group Recon

Don’t make separate RECON rolls.

- Sneaking: The PC with the lowest skill level rolls.
- Scouting: The PC with the highest skill level rolls.

The result applies to the whole group.

## Combat

- Actions: page 55.
- Terrain: page 56.
- Barriers: page 57.
- Weather & darkness: page 58.

### Surprise

If you initiate combat with an attack that the Referee deems fully surprising, you automatically get the #1 initiative card in the first round. All other combatants – including others on your side – draw initiative normally. Also see Ambushes (page 59).

### Ranged Combat (p. 62)

1. Roll **RANGED COMBAT** and **ammo dice**. Ranged fire modifications: page 65.
  - If attack hits with base dice, ammo dice success gives additional hits with base damage only.
  - If attack misses, ammo dice success can still suppress target.
  - If `>= 2` dice show 1 you suffer a mishap. If rolling only 1 dice, result `1` = mishap.
    - `Weapon reliability -1`. If it drops below D, the weapon breaks after the current attack (page 63).
    - Roll two dice corresponding with new reliability rating. Fail: weapon jams after the current attack. Clearing a jam: a slow **TECH** roll. If that fails, weapon breaks.
2. Ammo spent: sum of ammo dice results. If `sum > remaining ammo`, remove ammo dice until `sum <= remaining ammo`.
3. Inflict **damage**: weapon base damage and `+1` for each base dice success after the first one.
4. Roll **hit location**.

Weapon range number: SHORT range in hexes (page 64).
SHORT, -1 MEDIUM = 2 * SHORT, -2 LONG = 2 * MEDIUM, -3 EXTREME = 2 * LONG

SHOTGUNS: For shotguns, range gives no negative modifier to hit. Instead, the base damage is reduced by 1 at MEDIUM range, by 2 at LONG range, and by 3 at EXTREME range. Note that the base damage at EXTREME range for most shotguns will be zero, meaning you’ll need two to inflict 1 point of damage. Even a hit that inflicts no damage can cause suppression.

#### One-Handed Shooting (p. 65)

- Pistol: no penalty
- SMG: -2
- Rifle/AR: -3, only SHORT range

### Suppression (p. 65)

- If hit, or if any ammo dice in a miss show 6, roll **CUF** dice.
- If you see any non-incapacitated friendly, also roll **Unit Morale** dice.
- This is not an action, nor a skill roll so cannot push.

If CUF roll fails, you are suppressed: immediately drop prone, suffer 1 point of stress, and cannot perform any reactive actions until your next turn. Place a SUPPRESSED marker on your token on the battle map.

PANIC SPREADS: If you fail a CUF roll and get suppressed, all friendlies in the same hex roll **CUF**.

RECOVERY: On next turn, roll **CUF**. If the roll fails, lose both actions on this turn. If you succeed, you can perform a slow action, but you lose your fast action. In either case, you are no longer suppressed – remove the marker.

VEHICLES: A target fully inside a vehicle cannot be suppressed, but they can be forced to bail out (page xx).

### Friendly Fire (p. 66)

If your line of fire crosses a hex with friendlies they must immediately roll **CUF**. If you miss, roll D6 – on a 1 a random friendly is hit suffering base weapon damage.
